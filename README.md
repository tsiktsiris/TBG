The Bidding Game
========================

GitHub is transitioning to what we're calling "GitHub Flavored Markdown" (GFM) for messages, issues, and comments. It differs from standard Markdown (SM)
in a few significant ways and adds some additional functionality.

If you're not already familiar with Markdown, you should spend 15 minutes and go over the excellent [Markdown Syntax Guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) at Daring Fireball.
